history.py — Step 1 of the pipeline: a quarter of exports into one clean table.

Twelve weekly files become one DataFrame, and its text becomes numbers and dates.
Two lessons meet here:

- **Vectorized string methods (`.str`)** — `series.str.strip()` strips *every*
  value in the column at once. No `apply`, no loop: the method runs down the
  whole Series and hands back a new one.
- **Dates (`pd.to_datetime`, `.dt`)** — text like `"8/14/2026"` becomes a real
  date that knows its month, sorts correctly, and compares with `<` and `>`.

Assignment 04's lineage rule still holds for every function that returns a
row-level table:

    A pipeline step returns a WIDER copy of the frame it was given. It never
    changes a value it was handed, never removes or renames a column, and never
    modifies the caller's frame.

So the raw `" e004"` stays in `employeeid`, and `"E004"` goes in a new
`employee_id` column beside it.

The first three functions here take a **Series and return a Series** — one whole
column in, one whole column out, same length, same order. They are the `.str`
and `.dt` versions of Assignment 04's element functions.

This step is walked through line by line. The next two steps give you less.

def clean_employee_id(ids: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    """Normalize hand-typed employee IDs to the roster's `"E004"` form.

    Examples (one value per row of the Series):

        " e004"   ->  "E004"
        "E4"      ->  "E004"
        "e10 "    ->  "E010"
        "E012"    ->  "E012"     # already clean — unchanged

    How to build it:

    - `ids.str.strip()` removes the spaces around every value; chain
      `.str.upper()` onto it so `"e004"` and `"E004"` look the same.
    - Every ID is now `"E"` followed by a number with 1 to 3 digits. Take the
      digits with `.str[1:]` (slicing works on every value, just like a string),
      then pad them to three with `.str.zfill(3)`: `"4"` becomes `"004"`.
    - Put the letter back: `"E" + digits` adds `"E"` to the front of every value
      in the Series. Return that.
    - The mistake people make: stopping after `.upper()`. `"E4"` is not `"E004"`,
      and Step 2's merge will not match it to anyone on the roster.

      `.str.strip()`. (`regex=False` means "this exact character" — in a regular
      expression `$` means something else entirely.)
    - `pd.to_numeric(cleaned, errors="coerce")` turns the text into numbers, and
      `errors="coerce"` turns anything it cannot read into `NaN` instead of
      raising. That is Assignment 02's *coerce and carry on*, for a whole column.
    - `.fillna(0.0)` replaces those `NaN`s with zero. Return the result.

      methods do the looping for you.

def parse_pay_date(values: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:

    The old spreadsheet wrote US dates; the Assignment 04 exports write ISO dates:

    - Parse the whole column as US dates:
      `us = pd.to_datetime(values, format="%m/%d/%Y", errors="coerce")`.
      The ISO values do not fit that format, so `errors="coerce"` makes them `NaT`.
    - Parse it again as ISO dates with `format="%Y-%m-%d"` and `errors="coerce"`.
      Now the US values are the `NaT`s.
    - Every row is a date in at least one of the two. `us.fillna(iso)` keeps the
      US result where there is one and fills the holes from the ISO result.
      Anything that was neither stays `NaT`. Return that.
    - Why two passes, not one? A `format=` is a promise about every value, so a
      single format cannot read both styles — and guessing (leaving `format=` off)
      is how `"03/04/2026"` silently becomes April 3rd on someone's laptop.
