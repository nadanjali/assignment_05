summarize.py — Step 2 of the pipeline: the roster on, then one row per employee.

Two halves:

1. **Finish the history** — put a readable name and a department on every row
   (one more `.str` function and a merge you have written before), and chain
   Steps 1 and 2 into `build_history`, the one call the app makes.
2. **Change the grain** — `summarize_employees` turns *one row per person per
   week* into *one row per person*. That is a **group by**: split the rows into
   groups that share a key, compute something for each group, combine the answers
   into a new table (lesson 3-5).

A group-by does not break the lineage rule; it starts a *new* table at a new
grain, and every number in it is traceable to a group of rows in the history.
What it must not do is change the history it was handed.

Less scaffolding here: the steps are described, the code is yours.

    can be a function, too: a lambda that receives one group's hours as a Series.
