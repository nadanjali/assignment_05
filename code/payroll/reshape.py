reshape.py — Step 3 of the pipeline: the same numbers, turned sideways.

A **long** table has one row per observation (person, week, hours). A **wide**
table spreads one of those columns across the top, so a whole row reads like a
line on a timecard. People read wide tables; pipelines store long ones; and
lesson 3-5's `pivot_table` and `melt` turn one into the other.

Three functions:

- `hours_grid` — long to wide: employees down the side, weeks across the top.
- `missed_weeks` — wide back to long, to find something the long table could
  never show you: the weeks a person was **not** paid. Nobody's absence is a row
  in an export. It only exists once the grid has filled the gap with a zero.
- `pay_by_month` — months down the side, departments across the top: the table
  the accountant asked for, and the shape `st.bar_chart` wants.

No walkthrough. The docstrings say what each function returns; `tests/` says
how that is checked. None of these functions may change the frame it is given.
